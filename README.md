### Meta-analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) in Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD)

#### Description

Here we combined the data from two genetic studies in CHD and re-annotated 
the dataset using the Variant Effect Predictor (v90) tool. A mutation rate-based 
testing was performed to evaluate the impact of DNM at the gene level 
(MUPIT tool https://github.com/jeremymcrae/mupit). The analysis focused on rare 
variants with MAF (gnomad) < 0.1%.
