### Meta-analysis of de novo mutations (DNMs) in Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD)

#### Description

We here combined the data from the two largest genetic studies in CHD and re-annotated 
the dataset using the Variant Effect Predictor (v90) tool. A mutation rate-based 
testing was done to evaluate the impact of DNM at gene level 
(MUPIT tool https://github.com/jeremymcrae/mupit). The analysis focused on rare 
variants with a MAF 0.1%.
